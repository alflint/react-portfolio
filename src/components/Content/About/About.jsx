                                Hi there! My name is Alex, and I am a young professional working as a project manager in the medical devices field.
                                I am originally from New York, but I recently moved to Utah with my fianc√© to pursue a more fulfilling life and spend more time outside together.
                                In my free time, I love to be outdoors. During the summer, you can find me hiking and camping, exploring the beautiful mountains and national parks in the area.
                                In the winter, I enjoy skiing and snowboarding, taking advantage of the amazing ski resorts that Utah has to offer.
                                As a project manager in the medical devices field, I am passionate about improving patient outcomes and making a difference in people's lives.
                                I thrive on the challenges of managing complex projects, collaborating with teams, and finding innovative solutions.
                                I am also committed to continuous learning and growth, both personally and professionally. I am always seeking out new
                                opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, and I am constantly inspired by the amazing people I work with and the impact we are making in the world.
                                Thanks for getting to know me a little better!
